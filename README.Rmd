The goal of {nationwider} is to provide house price data from [<nationwide.co.uk>](https://www.nationwide.co.uk/). All datasets available have 
been curated using tidytools and returned in a convenient rectangular tidy format.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvasilopoulos/nationwider")
```
## Example

This is a basic example on how to download data with {nationwider}.

```{r example}
library(nationwider)

np <- nationwider::ntwd_get("new_prop")
np
```

We reshape our data from the initial form into a wider form.

```{r wrangling}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

np %>% 
  dplyr::filter(type == "Price") %>% 
  spread(region,value)
```

Here we are plotting all regions using type `Index` and `Price` as facets.

```{r plotting, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
np %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Date, value, col = region)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ type, scales = "free")
```
